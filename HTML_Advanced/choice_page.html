        <h2>Why I Love Rabbits</h2>
        <p>Perhaps bunnies are known for being some of the cutest and most interesting animals that can be domesticated. They are soft, flexible with fun personalities. It feels like they hop around to be entertaining. Bunnies are extremely curious and they show that as they wiggle their noses and stand on their hind legs. Rabbits can be hard to take care of, but even then they can make great pets because they can be litter trained and enjoy spending time with people.</p>
        
        <h2>Fun Facts About Rabbits</h2>
        <p>Did you know that rabbits can turn their ears almost all the way around? Their huge ears help them detect danger from far away. Once they feel the threat, they angrily start stomping their feet. Another fun fact about rabbits is that they have teeth that do not stop growing. To keep their dental health in check they need to chew on hay and hard toys to grind those teeth without letting them overgrow.  Last but not least, is that rabbits do a happy jump called a "binky" when they're excited!</p>
